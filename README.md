## Icebreaker
Start things off with a quick icebreaker activity so the students can get to know each other.

1. Explain how [AutoDraw](https://www.autodraw.com/) uses machine learning to guess what the user is trying to draw
1. Show how to get a link to the drawing: Hamburger menu in the upper left -> Share -> Copy Link -> Paste in Zoom chat

1. Post the link to AutoDraw in the Zoom chat (https://www.autodraw.com/)
1. Give the students a few minutes to create drawings of their own
1. Ask each student to post a link to their drawing in the Zoom chat
1. With screen shared, click on each link, and allow the students to introduce themselves

## Lecture
The lecture uses a [PowerPoint presentation](MachineLearning.pptx) to introduce students to machine learning. It introduces artificial intelligence and some of the concepts behind machine learning.

## Kahoot Quiz
There is a quick [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/8d6399d8-3979-45ad-bae5-52824765632f) to gauge how well the students were paying attention during the lecture.

## Follow-Along Activity
For the [follow-along activity](FollowAlong.md), get into Machine Learning for Kids and start building a program with the students.

## Challenges
The students should have a chance to attempt the [challenges](Challenges.md).
