# AI with Machine Learning for Kids
A workshop introducing [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk) in ~2hrs. Machine Learning for Kids introduces machine learning by providing hands-on experiences for training machine learning systems and building things with them.

### Camp Description
In this camp, students will use Machine Learning For Kids to create artificially intelligent programs. Students will learn the basics of Machine Learning, and then apply that knowledge to train a computer to recognize different types of data. They will also use programming to create a game with the computer's artificial intelligence.

### Student Content

## Icebreaker
Start things off with a quick icebreaker activity so the students can get to know each other.

1. Start by introducing [AutoDraw](https://www.autodraw.com/) - explain that it uses artificial intelligence to guess what the user is trying to draw, and briefly demonstrate its use.
1. Direct students to the [icebreaker instructions](Icebreaker.md)
    - Make sure they all go to the website and know how to draw/share
    - Give them a few minutes to draw and submit
1. Check submissions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5H-Zyl8yPrZ1bwpig63lj7-j8sDnSK10walWrbBdtw/edit?usp=sharing), and wait for everyone in the group to submit
1. Go through each submission, and have students introduce themselves while showing their drawing
    - They should share their name, grade, school, and maybe a fun fact like favorite food/movie/hobby

## Lecture
The lecture uses a [PowerPoint presentation](MachineLearning.pptx) to introduce students to machine learning. It introduces artificial intelligence and some of the concepts behind machine learning.

## Kahoot Quiz
There is a quick [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/8d6399d8-3979-45ad-bae5-52824765632f) to gauge how well the students were paying attention during the lecture.

## Follow-Along Activity
For the [follow-along activity](FollowAlong.md), get into Machine Learning for Kids and start building a program with the students.

## Challenges
The students should have a chance to attempt the [challenges](Challenges.md).
