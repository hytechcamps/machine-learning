# AI with Machine Learning for Kids
A workshop introducing [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk) in ~2hrs. Machine Learning for Kids introduces machine learning by providing hands-on experiences for training machine learning systems and building things with them.

## Icebreaker
Start things off with a quick icebreaker activity so the students can get to know each other. Have the students play with the [edges2cats](https://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/) tool to see what AI can do, then share their creations with the group. They can click the "Save" button and then add the image to chat (possibly a Campfire chat).

## Lecture
The lecture uses a [PowerPoint presentation](MachineLearning.pptx) to introduce students to machine learning. It introduces artificial intelligence and some of the concepts behind machine learning.

## Kahoot Quiz
There is a quick [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/8d6399d8-3979-45ad-bae5-52824765632f) to gauge how well the students were paying attention during the lecture.

## Follow-Along Activity
For the [follow-along activity](FollowAlong.md), get into Machine Learning for Kids and start building a program with the students.

## Challenges
The students should have a chance to attempt the [challenges](Challenges.md).
