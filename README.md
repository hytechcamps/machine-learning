# Programming Artificially Intelligent Apps
In this workshop, students will explore the fundamental concepts of modern artificial intelligence, and then create an AI-enabled program of their own. They will use a platform called "Machine Learning for Kids" to train an AI model to recognize different types of data. They will also use programming to create an application based around this machine learning model. By the end of the workshop, they will have gained a basic understanding of modern AI, and each student will have a custom machine learning model and app of their own design.

### Student Content

### Agenda
Here are some general guidelines for the overall flow of the camp:

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 30m |
| Presentation | 15m |
| Blooket | 10m |
| Break | 10m |
| Follow-Along | 40m |
| Challenges | 10m |
| Conclusion | 5m |

### Tips
Here are some tips to ensure a successful run:

- Before the activity, **read through this lesson plan thoroughly**
- During the activity, ask the students questions as often as possible
    - Ask for suggestions about what to do next
    - Poll them to see what they know, or what they'd like to do
- Make sure to turn off notifications for Teams, Outlook, etc
- Make sure to zoom in properly on smaller parts of the presenting screen
- Encourage students to make their own choices throughout the activities
    - The more they personalize their projects, the more fun they tend to have!
- Take it slow at first, and always check to see how the students are progressing
    - Don't trust them to tell you; make sure to actually have an assistant look at their screens and give the go-ahead
    - Give students time to catch up before moving too far ahead, but...
    - Don't stall too long on any one part

## Camp Outline
There are several parts of this camp - all of it flows through the [PowerPoint Presentation](ArtificiallyIntelligentApps.pptx).

### Icebreaker
Have students draw something using [AutoDraw](https://www.autodraw.com/), and introduce themselves along with what they drew. Follow the instructions from the [icebreaker guide](Icebreaker.md).

#### Drawing
Introduce [AutoDraw](https://autodraw.com/), and show some of the basic features. Explain that the app uses artificial intelligence to try to guess what you're drawing. Make sure all the students can get to the drawing site through the camp homepage, and give them some time to draw.

#### Submission
After a few minutes, students should submit their auto-drawings using the [form](https://forms.office.com/r/zVdcwp9zBd) linked on the [camp homepage](BOOKREADME.md). View responses in the [spreadsheet](https://hylandsw-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/joseph_maxwell_hyland_com/EeesMp-YV8JPjRxQk2j37dEBu3rr6CRo8Rlxq8gT1fwopw?e=Q0HMJ4); make sure to filter by the current room.

#### Show and Tell
Go through the responses, and call on each student. They should introduce themselves by sharing their name, grade, school, and drawing.

### Presentation
After students have warmed up with the icebreaker, it's time for the presentation portion of the [PowerPoint](ArtificiallyIntelligentApps.pptx). These slides contain a brief introduction to A.I. and machine learning. There are notes with talking points for each slide.

### Blooket
[Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) is a fun formative assessment tool that's similar to Kahoot, but more game-based. There are a variety of game modes where the students compete against each other in different ways. Answering questions correctly helps them achieve more success in each game.

>_For a Blooket guide with screenshots, [click here](https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/coding-activities/blob/main/BuildingAWebsiteLessonPlan.md#formative-assessment-blooket)_

An account is required to host the game; here are some credentials you can use:

- Username: **techoutinst**
- Password: **Tech0utreach**

When setting up the game, try to time it so that it ends just a couple minutes before the camp ends. Note that it will likely take 2-3 minutes for all the students to join the game, so a game time limit of **7 minutes** might end up taking about **10 minutes**.

1. Go to the [Blooket Login Page](https://id.blooket.com/login)
1. Enter the credentials above
1. Once logged into Blooket, go to the [question set](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/6644e2e40e5302d0bc9acebf)
1. Click the **Host** button
1. Select the **Fishing Frenzy** game mode (or another requested mode), and click the **Host Game** button
1. Adjust the time as needed, and click the **Host Now** button
1. Instruct students to go to **play.blooket.com**, enter the Game ID and a nickname, and join the game
1. Once all students have joined, click the **Start** button

From there, the students will work on their own, answering questions and trying to win the game!

### Follow-Along Activity
The next few slides introduce the [follow-along activity](FollowAlong.md). Start by briefly explaining [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk) as an online platform for building machine learning applications. It is totally free, and no accounts are required.

Next, have students open up the [Machine Learning for Kids Site](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk) linked from the [camp homepage](BOOKREADME.md).

From there, follow the [follow-along instructions](FollowAlong.md) to show the students how to build their own machine learning model and application!

### Challenges
Give students some time to update their apps. There are a bunch of things they can try by following the [guide](Challenges.md).

## Conclusion
Make sure to close out the camp on a strong, positive note of encouragement. Here are some key points to hit:

- Thank the students for participating
- Encourage them to continue learning about coding on their own
- Tell them they can reach us at **techoutreach@hyland.com** if they have any questions or would like any guidance
- Send them on their way!
