# Challenges
Complete any of the challenges below!

## Challenge 1: More Data
Add more training data to make the model even more robust!

1. Go back into the "Make me happy" project (_make sure not to close out the Scratch project_)
1. Go into the "Train" section, and add some new examples to each bucket
1. Click the "< Back to project" link in the upper left
1. Go into the "Learn & Test" section, scroll down, and click the "Train new machine learning model" button
1. Wait for the new model to train
1. When the model is trained, test it out with a few different messages
1. Switch back to the Scratch project to try out the new model in the app!

## Challenge 2: A Reply
Instead of simply changing costumes, the character should also say something depending on the message! Use the **say ...** block from the "Looks" category to accomplish this:

![](Assets/Challenges/reply.png)

Place one **say ...** block under the "happy" costume switch block, still within the **if** block. Change the message to make it a proper reply to something positive, like "That makes me happy!" Place another **say ...** block under the "sad" costume switch block, and change the message so it expresses sadness.

Now, when the character hears a message, it should change the costume _and_ say something in reply!

## Challenge 3: A New Bucket
So far, the model can recognize positive things and negative things. Add a new bucket so that the model can recognize another type of message too!

Ideas for new buckets:
- Weather-related things
- Sports-related things
- Funny things
- Food-related things
- Any other type of thing that is different from positive/negative

### New Model

1. Go back into the "Make me happy" project (_make sure not to close out the Scratch project_)
1. Go into the "Train" section, and click the "**+** Add new label" button to add the new label
1. Add some examples to the new bucket
1. Click the "< Back to project" link in the upper left
1. Go into the "Learn & Test" section, scroll down, and click the "Train new machine learning model" button
1. Wait for the new model to train
1. When the model is trained, test it out with a few different messages

### Scratch Application updates

1. Switch back to the Scratch project
1. Create a new costume for the character to react to the new label
1. Under the existing code, copy one of the **if** blocks above
1. Update the new **if** block so that it so it recognizes the new label and switches to the new costume

The code should look something like this:

![](Assets/Challenges/new_label_if.png)

Test out the new program to see if the character reacts appropriately!

## Challenge 4: Working with Confidence Intervals
>Resource: [Confidence Intervals](https://machinelearningmastery.com/report-classifier-performance-confidence-intervals/)
>Resource: [Thresholding](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/thresholding)

In machine learning, there is always a degree of uncertainty about a model's predictions. Sometimes there is very little uncertainty, and sometimes there is a lot of uncertainty. **Confidence intervals** allow developers to measure this uncertainty and act accordingly.

These confidence intervals may look familiar; they are used in the testing phase of Machine Learning for Kids models!

![](Assets/Challenges/confidence_test.png)

It is also possible to use these confidence intervals within the Scratch application.

### Updating the Scratch Application with Confidence

1. Go into the Scratch project (_make sure not to close out the Machine Learning For Kids project_)
1. Drag the blocks under the **ask** block away from the script; keep them elsewhere for later  
    ![](Assets/Challenges/whats_up_code.png)
1. From the "Control" category, click and drag an **if ... then ... else** block under the **ask** block  
    ![](Assets/Challenges/if_else.png)
1. Drag the old code into the **else** section of the **if ... then ... else** block  
    ![](Assets/Challenges/else_old_code.png)
1. From the "Operators" category, click and drag a pointy **... < ...** block into the pointy space in the **if** block  
    ![](Assets/Challenges/pointy_operator.png)
1. From the "Make me happy" category, click and drag a rounded **recognize text ... (confidence)** block into the rounded space on the left of the **... < ...** block  
    ![](Assets/Challenges/recognize_confidence.png)
1. From the "Sensing" category, click and drag a rounded **answer** block into the rounded "text" space in the **recognize text ... (confidence)** block  
    ![](Assets/Challenges/answer.png)
1. Set the "50" in the **... < ...** block to be any desired confidence interval
    - For example, if it were 70, the model would be "not sure" if its confidence interval was 70 or lower
1. From the "Looks" category, click and drag a **say ...** block into the top **if** block
1. Update the text in the new **say ...** block to say that the character is not sure how to feel  
    ![](Assets/Challenges/say_not_sure.png)
1. Run the program to test how it works!

Go back and adjust the confidence interval in the code if necessary. 

## Challenge 5: Other Worksheets
There are [several worksheets](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/worksheets) available online for the Machine Learning For Kids platform. Feel free to try any of them that look interesting!

### Beginner
These worksheets are a little simpler:

- [Shy Panda](https://github.com/IBM/taxinomitis-docs/raw/master/project-worksheets/pdf/worksheet-shypanda.pdf): Make a dancing panda that gets shy and stops dancing if it sees you looking.
- [Car or Cup](https://github.com/IBM/taxinomitis-docs/raw/master/project-worksheets/pdf/worksheet-carorcup.pdf): Train the computer to be able to sort photos into groups.

### Intermediate
This worksheet is a little more complex:

- [Judge a Book](https://github.com/IBM/taxinomitis-docs/raw/master/project-worksheets/pdf/worksheet-judgeabook-easy.pdf): Create a model to recognize the genre of books based on their cover art.
